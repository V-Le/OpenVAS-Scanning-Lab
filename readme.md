# Vulnerability Scanning & Remediation Using OpenVAS

In this homelab, I set up a virtualized environment using Oracle VirtualBox, deploying an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM and a vulnerable Windows 10 VM. I simulated a security testing scenario by intentionally installing outdated software on the Windows 10 VM and performing both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans with OpenVAS. I then analyzed the scan results, remediated the identified vulnerabilities, and verified improvements through subsequent rescans.

This lab provided hands-on experience in vulnerability scanning, system hardening, and patch management.

- Set up a virtualized homelab environment using Oracle VirtualBox, deploying an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM and a vulnerable Windows 10 VM.  
- Developed a vulnerable Windows 10 VM by intentionally installing outdated software and disabling security controls to simulate common real-world vulnerabilities.  
- Performed unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS, comparing results between both methods to identify security gaps.  
- Analyzed and documented scan results, highlighting the differences in findings between unauthenticated and credentialed scans, and assessed the impact of vulnerabilities.  
- Remediated identified vulnerabilities through system patching, configuration changes, and security updates, then verified successful remediation by rescanning with OpenVAS.  
- Created a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and remediation steps, simulating realistic vulnerability remediation scenarios for improving system security.
